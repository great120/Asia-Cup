        <img class="img1" src="ACC_Asia_Cup_2022_UAE_Logo.png" alt="" title="Asia Cup UAE 2022">
        <p>Asia Cup also known as Asian Cricket Council Asia Cup is a cricket tournament played between Asian Countries. It was first held in 1984 at UAE(United Arab Emirates). This tournament supports One Day International(50 over) and Twenty20 International(20 over) format matches .The Asian Cricket Council (ACC) is the governing body for the Asia Cup tournament and hosts the tournament. The format of the tournament is Group Stage and knockout. It alternates every 2-years between ODI, 50 overs and T20I formats. After downsizing the Asian Cricket Council in 2015, it was announced by the ICC that Asia Cup events from 2016 would be played on a rotation basis between One Day International and Twenty20 International format, on the basis of the format of upcoming world events. As a result, the 2016 event was the first event played in the T20I format and functioned as a preparatory tournament ahead of the 2016 ICC World Twenty20. India, with seven titles (six ODI and one T20I), is the most successful team in the tournament. Sri Lanka is the second most successful team, with six. Sri Lanka has played the most Asia Cups (14) followed by India, Pakistan and Bangladesh who have played 13 each.</p>
